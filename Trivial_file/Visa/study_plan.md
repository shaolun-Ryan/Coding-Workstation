* BRIEF INTRODUCTION: *Because of family and personal hobbies, I plan to choose the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China giving lecture to pursue my career. Because I like the feeling of being on campus, the strong academic atmosphere there and the comfortable environment of Chengdu. I and my partners agreed to come back to the alma mater to meet together. My alma mater's data visualization field has yet to be improved and freshed, so I dream of becoming the one who promotes the development of school visualization. In addition, my parents and my current girlfriends also like Chengdu very much. My parents have bought a property in Chengdu, so if this all comes true, it is the best choice for me and my family.*
