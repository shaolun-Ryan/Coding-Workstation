## 常见问题
* What are you gonna study in the US?
  * As this offer shown I was admitted for Fall 2019 to the Doctor of Philosophy Program in CS at Kent State University. The admission has a grade condition though I think it is easy to meet and it doesnt matter.
* Why you choose USA to study your major?
  * As we all know, America is such a good place in the Computer Science, especially in the field I'll research in--the data visualization. Visualization in America is so advanced that I could enjoy the most wonderful researching atmosphere there and get learning opportunities as much as possible. It would be such an honorable and precious opportunity to work with these excellent faculty and learn the latest information about CS research.
* Why you choose this university?\Why you pick your current school?
  * The first time I know this university is a basketball game I saw in 2017 via a cell phone. The uniform in blue and thier play really impressed me. 
  * Secondly, KSU is one of the most influential research university in the world, to be honest, I'm very flattered when I found out I was admitted by KSU. At the same time, KSU has a very cozy and safe community for foreign students to live and study. I'm very excited I will go further study there.
* What would you do after you graduate?
  * A university lecturer, likely. And it will be great if I have a chance to go back to my undergraduate school to develop my career. Cuz you know, UESTC is one of the most dominant universities in China in CS and its new campus is just built ,its very fresh. On the other hand, as you know, Chengdu is such a wonderful place for people to live. It has a slow pace of life and I feel confortable staying here. And five years passed, I think I like her more and more. This will be a long-term goal I will persue.
* What is your academic plan?

* Any other university admitted you?
* When will you fly to the US?
* What do your parents do in China?
* Do you have any relatives in America?
