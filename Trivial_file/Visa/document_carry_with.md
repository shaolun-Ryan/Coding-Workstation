## 常见问题
* What are you gonna study in the US?
  * As this offer shown I was admitted for Fall 2019 to the Doctor of Philosophy Program in CS at Kent State University. The admission has a grade condition though I think it is easy to meet and it doesnt matter.
* Why you choose USA to study your major?
  * As we all know, America is such a good place in the Computer Science, especially in the field I'll research in--the data visualization. Visualization in America is so advanced that I could enjoy the most wonderful researching atmosphere there and get learning opportunities as much as possible. It would be such an honorable and precious opportunity to work with these excellent faculty and learn the latest information about CS research.
* Why you choose this university?\Why you pick your current school?
  * The first time I know this university is a basketball game I saw in 2017 via a cell phone. The uniform in blue and thier play really impressed me. 
  * Secondly, KSU is one of the most influential research university in the world, to be honest, I'm very flattered when I found out I was admitted by KSU. At the same time, KSU has a very cozy and safe community for foreign students to live and study. I'm very excited I will go further study there.
* What would you do after you graduate?
  * A university lecturer, likely. And it will be great if I have a chance to go back to my undergraduate school to develop my career. Cuz you know, UESTC is one of the most dominant universities in China in CS and its new campus is just built ,its very fresh. On the other hand, as you know, Chengdu is such a wonderful place for people to live. It has a slow pace of life and I feel confortable staying here. And five years passed, I think I like her more and more. This will be a long-term goal I will persue.
* What is your academic plan?
  * About this, here is my study plan and you can check if you want.
* Any other university admitted you?
  * There's one more university , the University of Leeds in the United Kingdom, admitted me in Auguest last year. And then I met Professer Guan in a project we worked together and I was told Professor Guan attached great importance to me and I could went to America to go further research with him. So I stopped my applications of any other universities sooner than others. I think I'm a really lucky guy.
* When will you fly to the US?
  * Early August, if everything goes well.
* What do your parents do in China?
  * They are both civil servants working in my hometown LanZhou.
  * My mom named Yue Wang and my father named Aoxiang Ruan. Any basic information are shown in the copy of account(***hand in***) and ang material about their deposit are here(***hand in***).
* Do you have any relatives in America?
  * No, I dont have any relatives in America. Im solitary to go there for my study and research.
* How did you get to know your supervisor?
  * The encounter between me and my supervisor is purely accidental. He was invited to give a academic talk about data vis at our campus. I was one of the audients and luckily the topic is my major at the time. So I went to communicate with him after the talk. We had a nice communication and he asked me if I can do some research with his group.I said yes. So this is the origin about me and my supervisor.
* How long will you study in USA? 
  * Almost 5 years, I think. The first several months, I will do my research with an academic condition. Its about 9 credit that I need to earn a grade of 'B'. And then I will go further research there until I get my Phd degree. All of them will take about 5 years.
* 9.Have you get any scholarship?
  * yes.I get my research assistantship from my school and my supervisor. It can almost cover all of my tuition and living expenses. Besides, my parents can give me enough financial support to complete my study in the US. You can check my finacial 
* What’s the difference between the education of China and USA?
  * First, there is a large number of international student in US, so I can make friends with them and learn more about different culture and language. Second，in the classroom of an American universities, the teacher always use many ways to help students master the knowledge he or she has taught. These ways including some teamwork, essays, seminars and quizs. I think that those are very helpful, because you must know how to use the things you learned to solve different problems, otherwise what you got is just a bunch of elusive theories
* 20.Why not continue your study in China?
  * Cuz I'm a young man and I wanna see the world outside of China. And As for the field I research currently, America is leading the world and has a very great learning environment. When my doctoral career is over, I guess I will go back to China for my parents and my job.
* If you didn’t get the visa, what can you do?
  * I am confident enough to be eligible to get the visa, and I really hope to get your support.
I went to America for study further, and for pursuing my dream. I still remember how excited I was when I get the offer from NYU, I treasure this opportunity very much.
Besides, my documents are prepared very sufficient. But if I failed, I will just have another try. I won’t give up.
